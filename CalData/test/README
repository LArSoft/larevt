This directory contains a test of the response of SimWire (convolution) plus
CalWire (deconvolution) to a delta-function input.  Running this test
requires two separate invocations of the lar executable.

lar -c simwire_argoneut.fcl
lar -c ffttest_argoneut.fcl

or

lar -c simwire_uboone.fcl
lar -c ffttest_uboone.fcl

The first invocation generates the convolution response function and
stores it in root file.  The second invocation actually tests the
response functions.

Both invocations can be done in a single command using script ffttest.sh.

ffttest.sh <experiment>

where <experiment> is argoneut or uboone (or microboone).

Test output is stored in root file caldata_test_<experiment>.root.

The input consists of an impulse at tick=100.  Various histograms show the
shaped signal, with the final result in histogram "deconv".
